 Falling Distance
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
d 5 ½ gt2
The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the
amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Write a function named falling_distance that accepts an object’s falling time (in seconds)
as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has
fallen during that time interval. Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes
the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.

def falling_distance(seconds):
    d=9.8 * 0.5 * seconds
    print("Distance in meter is : ",d)

for i in range(1,11):
    falling_distance(i)
