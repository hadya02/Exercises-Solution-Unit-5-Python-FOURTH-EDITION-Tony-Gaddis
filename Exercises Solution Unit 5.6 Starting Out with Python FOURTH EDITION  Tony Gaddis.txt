A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part
of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams
that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from
the fat, using the following formula:
calories from fat 5 fat grams 3 9

Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the
following formula:
calories from carbs 5 carb grams 3 4
The nutritionist asks you to write a program that will make these calculations.

fat = float(input("enter the number of fat grams you consumed in a day : "))
carbohydrate = float(input("enter the number of carbohydrate grams you consumed in a day : "))
fatcalories = fat * 9
carcalories = carbohydrate * 4
print("the calories from fat is : ",fatcalories)
print("the calories from carbohydrate is : ",carcalories)
