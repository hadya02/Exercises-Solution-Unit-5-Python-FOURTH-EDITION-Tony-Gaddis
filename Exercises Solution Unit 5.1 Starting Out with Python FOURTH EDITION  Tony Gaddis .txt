 Kilometer Converter
Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, then converts that
distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:
Miles 5 Kilometers 3 0.6214

 miles = kilometers x 0.6214
kilometer = int(input("enter a distance in kilometers : "))
miles = kilometer * 0.6214
print("distance in Miles : ",miles)
