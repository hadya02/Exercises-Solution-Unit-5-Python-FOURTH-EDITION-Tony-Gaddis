 Automobile Costs
Write a program that asks the user to enter the monthly costs for the following expenses
incurred from operating his or her automobile: loan payment, insurance, gas, oil, tires, and
maintenance. The program should then display the total monthly cost of these expenses,
and the total annual cost of these expenses.

loan = float (input("enter the monthly costs for the loan payment : "))
insurance = float (input("enter the monthly costs for the insurance : "))
gas = float (input("enter the monthly costs for the gas : "))
oil = float (input("enter the monthly costs for the oils : "))
tire = float (input("enter the monthly costs for the tires : "))
maintenance = float (input("enter the monthly costs for the maintenance : "))

totalmonthly = loan + insurance + gas + oil + tire + maintenance
totalannual = totalmonthly * 12

print("the total monthly cost of these expenses are : ",totalmonthly)
print("the total annual cost of these expeses are : ",totalannual)
