 Monthly Sales Tax
A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month,
and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 5 percent
and the county sales tax rate is 2.5 percent. Write a program that asks the user to enter
the total sales for the month. From this figure, the application should calculate and display
the following:
• The amount of county sales tax
• The amount of state sales tax
• The total sales tax (county plus state)

sales = float(input("enter the total sales for the month : "))
countrytax = sales * 0.025
statetax = sales * 0.05
print("the amount of the country sales tax : ",countrytax)
print("the amount of state sales tax : ",statetax)
print("the total sales tax : ",countrytax + statetax)
