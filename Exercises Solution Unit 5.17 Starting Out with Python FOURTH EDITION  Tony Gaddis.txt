Prime Numbers
A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the
number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Write a Boolean function named is_prime which takes an integer as an argument and
returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise. Use the function in
a program that prompts the user to enter a number then displays a message indicating
whether the number is prime.
TIP: Recall that the % operator divides one number by another and returns the
remainder of the division. In an expression such as num1 % num2, the % operator will
return 0 if num1 is evenly divisible by num2.


def is_prime(number):
    for i in range(2,number):
        if number % i == 0 :
            return True
        else :
            return False

number = int(input("enter a number : "))
if is_prime(number):
    print("this is a not prime number")
else:
    print("this is a prime number")
