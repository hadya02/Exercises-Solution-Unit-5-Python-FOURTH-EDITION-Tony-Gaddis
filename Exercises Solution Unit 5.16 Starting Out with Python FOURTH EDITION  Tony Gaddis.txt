Odd/Even Counter
In this chapter, you saw an example of how to write an algorithm that determines
whether a number is even or odd. Write a program that generates 100 random numbers
and keeps a count of how many of those random numbers are even, and how many of
them are odd.

import random

number = []
even = 0
odd = 0

for i in range(100):
    num = random.randint(1,100000)
    number.append(num)
    if num % 2 == 0 :
        even += 1
    else:
        odd += 1
print(number)
print(even,"is Even")
print(odd,"is Odd")
