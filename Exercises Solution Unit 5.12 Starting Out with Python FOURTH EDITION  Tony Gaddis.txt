Maximum of Two Values
Write a function named max that accepts two integer values as arguments and returns the
value that is the greater of the two. For example, if 7 and 12 are passed as arguments to
the function, the function should return 12. Use the function in a program that prompts the
user to enter two integer values. The program should display the value that is the greater
of the two.



def max(num1,num2):
    if num1 > num2 :
        print("The greater is",num1)
    elif num2 > num1 :
        print("The greater is",num2)
    else:
        print("The numbers are same.")

# example
max(12,1)
