Prime Number List
This exercise assumes that you have already written the is_prime function in Programming
Exercise 17. Write another program that displays all of the prime numbers from 1 to 100.
The program should have a loop that calls the is_prime function.

def is_prime(number):
    for i in range(2,number):
        if number % i == 0 :
            return True
        else :
            return False

for number in range(1,101):
    if is_prime(number):
        continue
    else:
        print(number)
