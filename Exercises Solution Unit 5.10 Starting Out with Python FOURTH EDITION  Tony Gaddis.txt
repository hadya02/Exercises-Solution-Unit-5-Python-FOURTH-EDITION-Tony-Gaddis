Feet to Inches
One foot equals 12 inches. Write a function named feet_to_inches that accepts a number
of feet as an argument and returns the number of inches in that many feet. Use the function
in a program that prompts the user to enter a number of feet then displays the number of
inches in that many feet.

def feet_to_inches(feet):
    inches = feet * 12
    print("the number of inches : ",inches)
# example
feet = float(input("enter the number of feet : "))
