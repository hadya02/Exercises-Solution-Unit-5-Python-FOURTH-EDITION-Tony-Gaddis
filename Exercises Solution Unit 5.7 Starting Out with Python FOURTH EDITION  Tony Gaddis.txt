Stadium Seating
There are three seating categories at a stadium. Class A seats cost $20, Class B seats cost
$15, and Class C seats cost $10. Write a program that asks how many tickets for each class
of seats were sold, then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales.

 class A cost $20, class B cost $15, and class C cost $10
classA = int(input("how many tickets for class A is sold : "))
classB = int(input("how many tickets for class B is sold : "))
classC = int(input("how many tickets for class C is sold : "))
total = (classA*20)+(classB*15)+(classC*10)
print("the total amount is $",total)
